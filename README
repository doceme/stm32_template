This project is a template for building, flashing, and debugging code for the STM32 series of
microcontrollers using open source tools like GCC and OpenOCD.

Specifically, this template is designed to work with the [STM32 VL Discovery board](http://www.st.com/internet/evalboard/product/250863.jsp).
